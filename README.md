# VillagerNames
You can find the latest releases from the parent repository of this mod on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/villager-names-for-fabric/)
## Overview
When we are playing Minecraft, we are presented to a very large amount of Mobs. Most of them are either passive or aggressive. But only two can be considered your allies. The tamed wolves and the Villagers (No, cats doesn't count. They really don't care about you).

Villagers are very useful, if not a bit dumb sometimes. We rely on them for their trades, for our automated crops and Iron Farms. But they don't have the recognition they deserve. Of course, you can name them with nametags, but is it REALISTIC? Is it IMMERSIVE?? NO!

The scope of this mod is to bring more life into your game. Every villager that spawn in your world would be given a name randomly, from a list of over 6000 names. And you can change the names to be whatever you want.
This way, every one of those big noses will be a person, not a thing. And you will feel bad when shoving them in lava because you don't like their trades. 

 

This eventually will be part of a bigger groups of Mods, designed to work both together and individually. So, if you like this mod, keep your eyes open for more stuff coming in the future.

**Please note that the config requires a restart on the server to apply changes in it.**
